- Enhanced error handling

## Files Modified

### Core Pages:
- `src/pages/Questionnaire.jsx` - Complete restructuring with 7 steps

### New Components:
- `src/components/UserProfileStep.jsx` - User profile collection
- `src/components/SkillTagsInput.jsx` - Enhanced skill selection

### Services & Data:
- `src/services/api.js` - Removed budget from API calls
- `src/mocks/mockApi.js` - Updated mock responses

### Configuration:
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Already had Google colors (no changes needed)

## Functionality Preserved

### ✅ Exact Same Core Functionality:
- Form validation and submission flow
- API endpoint calls (minus budget field)
- Loading states and error handling
- Navigation between steps
- Data persistence in context
- Mock API fallbacks

### ✅ Enhanced Features:
- More comprehensive user profiling
- Better skill collection with search
- AI consent and customization options
- Improved visual design and UX

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests Required:
- [ ] Complete questionnaire flow (all 7 steps)
- [ ] Form validation on required fields
- [ ] Skill tags search and selection
- [ ] API submission (verify budget field removed)
- [ ] Mock API fallback when backend unavailable
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Loading states and animations

### Network Requests to Verify:
- POST `/api/ai/suggest` should NOT contain `budgetPerMonth`
- All other questionnaire fields should be present
- Headers and authentication unchanged

## Next Steps

1. Test the enhanced questionnaire flow
2. Verify AI features work with new data structure
3. Consider adding analytics for new user profile fields
4. Potential server-side updates to handle new fields (marked as SERVER CHANGE REQUIRED if needed)

## Do Not Touch Files

- `server/` directory and all server files
- Server environment variables
- Backend API routes and logic
- Database schemas (unless specifically confirmed)
